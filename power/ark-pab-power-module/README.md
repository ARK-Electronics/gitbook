# ARK PAB Power Module

The ARK PAB Power Module is rated for 60A continuous battery current at 20C ambient. However, when running 60A battery current at 20C without cooling, the 5V regulator is de-rated to 3A continuous output. It is recommended to run multiple power modules in parallel if more than 60A continuous current is required.
