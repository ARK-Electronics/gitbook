# Aruco Detectios Tutorial

Explore the integration of ROS2, PX4, and OpenCV for advanced ArUco marker detection. In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to leverage ROS2's powerful communication framework and PX4's flight control capabilities to implement precise marker detection using OpenCV. Learn how to set up your environment, process camera feeds, and detect ArUco markers in real-time, enabling enhanced navigation and interaction for autonomous drones and robotic systems. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this tutorial will guide you through the essential steps to achieve robust marker detection and seamless integration with your ROS2 and PX4 projects.
