# Mastering Precision Landing with PX4 & ROS2

Master the integration of ROS2, PX4, and OpenCV to achieve precision landing using ArUco marker detection. This tutorial delves into how to leverage ROS2's robust communication framework and PX4's flight control system to implement highly accurate landings for autonomous drones. You'll learn how to configure your environment, process camera feeds, and detect ArUco markers in real-time, enabling your drone to land precisely at designated targets. Whether you're new to drone development or an experienced engineer, this guide provides a step-by-step approach to achieving reliable precision landing with seamless integration into your ROS2 and PX4 projects.
