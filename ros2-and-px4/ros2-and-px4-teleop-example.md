# ROS2 & PX4 Teleop Example

We previously had a popular [ros2\_px4\_offboard\_example](https://github.com/ARK-Electronics/ROS2_PX4_Offboard_Example) based on Python and the offboard control mode. However, maintaining it became challenging. In this repository, we've migrated the code to C++ and implemented it using a Custom PX4 Flight Mode(PX4 ROS 2 Interface Library) for improved maintainability and performance.\
